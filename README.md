a simple demo of downloading and analyzing tweets of a list of key words(sentimental analysis & text-mining) 
1. Sentimental analysis for 8 fashion companies is completed. 
80k tweets (about 50 MB) were pulled off. The emotional value ("anger", "disgust", "joy", "fear", "sadness", "surprise") for each tweet was analyzed and the polarity ("positive", "negative", "neutral") for each tweet was assigned.
The results were displayed in a bar chart.
2. Text-mining of a single brand.
Tiffany & Co among all showed highest ratio of "joy" among all tweets. A wordcloud of "hot words" was generated for it.
